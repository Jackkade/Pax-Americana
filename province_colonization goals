send colonist -> ticks up until 1000 pop -> you have territorial core

Issues with current system:
-restricted by number of colonists
-heavily encourages modifier stacking
-not tied to size of country
-"free" development
-bad ai colonization
-takes an idea slot to even participate

Goals of the new system:
-Model different styles of colonization
-Not tied to amount of colonists
-Cost dev points in some manner
-Reasonable spread of development
-Show Uncolonized natives better
