# Colony Rework:
- Rework of how Colonies grow into provinces
- Colonies no longer automatically convert culture and religion.
- After finishing the intial setup of the colony, the province will be given a new modifier,
  Newly Established Colony. This modifier nullifies all economic benefits of the province except
  trade, as well as costs the nation 2 ducats per month.
  To remove the modifier, build 3 buildings, build a manufactory, develop it 5 times, 
  expand infrastructure, or wait 25 years. 
- When the modifier is removed, The colony will convert
  to your culture and religion if it is in the new world.
- Rebalanced Expansion and Exploration Ideas around this system.
- Settler chance now gives 50 population when it succeeds instead of 25
- 10 provinces are now required to form a colonial nation
- Colonial nations get economic buffs when forming so that they do not collapse
- Colonial nations are refunded the cost of the colonies they inherit
